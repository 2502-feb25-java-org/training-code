#  Object Oriented Programming 

A programming paradigm centered around objects as the modular form of code. Here, classes represent objects. All objects have state(instance variables) and behavior(methods).

In OOP, there are four principle attributes that define the paradigm, known as the pillars of OOP:
* Abstraction - the hiding of implementation details. We see this implemented in Java through abstract classes/methods and interfaces
* Polymorphism - the ability of objects to act in different manners based on various things like how the object is instantiated, how a method is called, etc. We see this implemented in Java through method overloading, method overriding, and instantiating objects with a reference to a parent class
* Inheritance - the ability of objects to inherit behavior from other classes. We see this in Java from extends(class extends class, interface extends interface) or implements ( class implements interface)
* Encapsulation - the hiding of access to fields of a class. We see this in java with private instance variables, and public getter and setter methods.
