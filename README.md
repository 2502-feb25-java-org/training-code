#Environment Setup


#github

www.github,com
Create an account
We will use this for version control, class examples, and submission of your assignments



#Slack

www.slack.com
Create a slack account.
We will use this for communications between the group outside of work hours. Hell, even during.



#AT THIS POINT USE SLACK AND MESSAGE ME THE FOLLOWING

#Github username

#JDK

x64 for 64 bit systems, x86 for 32 bit systems
Set environment variables

set 'path' to have directory of 'bin' folder for JDK (eg ..\java\jdk_version\bin)
set JAVA_HOME -> \java\jdk_version





#Java IDE - Spring Tool Suite

Make sure you get the version that corresponds to your operating system! (eg 64 bit vs 32 bit)



#Oracle11g

This will be the dominant SQL database that we use. Restricted to Windows OS only



#SQL Developer

This will be the IDE we use for SQL development.
Do NOT download the package with the JDK included. It'll just cause a mess...



#Maven

Extract to your C drive (Download the latest maven version that is a bin.zip)
After extracting, set the following environment variables

M2_HOME -> set to the root folder of maven
M2 -> set to %M2_HOME%\bin
Add %M2% to your 'path' variable





#Hacker Rank

Good source of practice. Use it often for practice. Of course, if you still have assigned work to do, that work takes precedence.
