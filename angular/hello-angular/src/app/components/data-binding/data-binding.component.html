<h4>Data Binding</h4>
<i>Angular supports data binding, which is a mechanism for 
  coordinating parrts of a template(HTML) with parts of a 
  component(TS)
</i>
<br>
<p>There are a few different types of data binding</p>
<h5>String Interpolation</h5>
String interpolation uses double curly braces to display 
data represented in the component.ts or to evaluate expressions. 
There are many things we can do with this, however it does have 
some restrictions, such as we cannot create new objects in 
template expressions 
Examples:
<ul>
  <li>Math: 2 + 2 = {{ 2 + 2 }}</li>
  <li>Expressions: 10 > 2 ? = 
    {{ 10 > 2 ? 'yes' : 'no'}}
  </li>
  <li>My name is {{ name | uppercase  }} </li>
  <li>Time: {{ time | date:'medium' | uppercase }} </li>
  <li>Here, we are exploring money pipes, 
    1000000 dollars => {{ 1000000 | currency:'CAD' }}
  </li>
  <li>Here, we are using our custom square root pipe 
    to get the square root of 10000 {{ 4 | sqroot }}
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Event Binding</h5>
This is another form of data binding which links actions directly 
to DOM elements -- we do this by adding our events to our elements 
in the opening tag as a special attribute 
<code><pre>  &lt;element (event) = "function()> </pre></code>

<button class="btn btn-secondary"
 (click) = "increment()">
  Click Me!</button> {{count}}

<h5 [style.background-color] = "colorProp">Property Binding</h5>
This allows us to apply a property to a DOM element dynamically. 
There are many types of property binding. 
<code><pre>  &lt;element [property] = "variable"> </pre></code>

<h5>Two-way data binding</h5>
Thus far, our data bindings have bound either our template to our 
typescript ( HTML --> TS = event binding), or our typescript to our HTML
(TS --> HTML = property binding and template expressions). But 
how can we establish a relationship that goes both ways between template
and TS. We want to no longer have to obtain data from input field values - 
we simply want our input fields to represent some data. We do this 
with something called a 'Directive', and a special one at that 
This directive is <b>ngModel</b>. In order to use this, however, our @NgModule
must import the FormsModule

<br>
<input type="text" [(ngModel)]="name">
<input type="color" [(ngModel)]="colorProp">
