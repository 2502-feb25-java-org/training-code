<p>
  This is our first component, nested inside of
  the root component AKA app.component.ts

  Components are entities in angular that manage
  parts of a webpage or view.

  The are typescript classes decorated with <code>@Component</code>
  which allow us to tightly bind code with a view

  We can use the Angular CLI to generate components
  with the <code>ng g c [name]</code> command
