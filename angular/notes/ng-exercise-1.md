# A List of Authors

Use what you have learned in `ng-notes-1` and `ng-notes-2` to build a page that has a heading (h1) that says: "Angular". Below it should be another heading (h2) that says: "# Authors", where # is replaced with the number of authors in a list. Finally, below this heading, include an unordered list that displays a list ite containing the name of each author in the authors list.

You should use the nG CLI to generate component and a service that are both used to accomplish this task.

# Solution

##### The solution to this exercise can be found in the files within the *authors-component* folder and *authors.service.ts* inside of the ng-demo project
